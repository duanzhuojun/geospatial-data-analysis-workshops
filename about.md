# About the Workshops

## Overview

The Geospatial Data Analysis Workshops series is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in severe weather analysis. Through hands-on exercises and real-world datasets, participants learn cutting-edge techniques in geospatial data science.

## Workshop Philosophy

Our approach emphasizes:

- **Hands-on Learning**: Every concept is reinforced with practical exercises
- **Real-World Data**: Work with actual thunderstorm and lightning datasets
- **Reproducible Research**: Learn best practices for transparent, shareable analysis
- **Open Science**: All materials are freely available and open source

## Who Should Attend

These workshops are ideal for:

- Graduate students in atmospheric sciences, meteorology, or geography
- Researchers working with geospatial or environmental data
- Data scientists interested in weather and climate applications
- Anyone curious about spatial data analysis and visualization

## Instructor

**Zhuojun Duan** is a researcher specializing in geospatial data analysis and severe weather studies. With expertise in data mining, spatial statistics, and meteorological applications, Zhuojun has developed innovative approaches to understanding thunderstorm patterns and lightning behavior.

### Background
- Research focus: Geospatial analysis of severe weather phenomena
- Experience with large-scale environmental datasets
- Developer of open-source tools for meteorological data analysis

## Workshop History

These materials have been developed and refined through multiple workshop sessions, incorporating feedback from participants and advances in geospatial data science.

## Acknowledgments

This workshop series builds upon excellent open-source tools and datasets from:
- The Python geospatial community
- NOAA and other meteorological data providers
- Contributors to GeoPandas, Cartopy, and related projects
