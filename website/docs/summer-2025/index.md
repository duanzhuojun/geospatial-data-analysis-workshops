## Tracks

There are three tracks in the summer camp.

### Track 1: Getting Started with Twoville

Dr. Chris Johnson and his family members return for the next installment of their summer camp track that introduces computing in the context of vector graphics and animations, perfect for sending to a vinyl cutter to make stickers!

Find more information in [the Track 1 - Twoville section of this site](Track-1-Twoville/index.md).


### Track 2: Getting Started with the Web and Virtual Reality

More soon...

### Track 3: Applied

The track starts by building foundational Python programming skills. Next, students apply Python to cybersecurity concepts, focusing on encryption and message decoding. Midweek, they get hands-on experience with Internet of Things (IoT) technology using Arduino sensors. Finally, participants create interactive mobile apps with MIT App Inventor.
