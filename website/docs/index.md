# Overview

Since 2019, the JMU Computer Science Department has partnered with the CWS Harrisonburg Immigration and Refugee Program to host an annual summer computing camp designed for local refugee students. Many of these students come from regions with limited access to technology or reliable internet, making this camp a vital opportunity to explore the world of computing in a supportive environment.

The camp introduces participants to the basics of programming and helps them build confidence through hands-on experience. Undergraduate CS students serve as teaching assistants, offering personalized guidance and support throughout the camp.
